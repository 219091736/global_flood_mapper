<h2> Steps to follow to generate the flood map: </h2><br/>
1. Select the country and area from the drop-down menu highlighted in 1.<br/>
2. Select a date range of about one-two months before the floods. The start date and the number of succeeding days (defaults to 60). This should be selected in the option highlighted in 2.<br/>
3. With some rough idea about the flood dates, select a date range as highlighted in 3. This should be the minimum number of days required to cover the area.<br/>
4. Switch of the flood map as shown in 4, toggle between the pre and during flood images using the slider in the centre. Check a few values for the during-flood date range and finalise one that shows the most difference visually while toggling. Water/sand appears dark in colour, but a change in black from pre and during image will only represent new water.<br/>
5. Turn on the flood map. Click on the download button to get the extent as SHP or the exact same flood map as PNG, as shown in 5. The files can be downloaded for a zoomed-in extent also, by checking the box above the download button.<br/>
