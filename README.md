This repository contains the link to the global flood mapper tool as described in the article <em><strong>"Global Flood Mapper: A novel Google Earth Engine application for rapid flood mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR"</strong></em>.<br/>

There are two versions of the tool, basic and advanced. Please read the usage instructions here [[link]](/instructions). A journal article with the detiled methods will be out soon. Please find a few examples here [[link]](/examples).<br/>

## Basic version - [link](https://pratyush_tripathy.users.earthengine.app/view/global-flood-mapper)<br/>
The basic version of the tool allows the user to quickly create high-precision flood maps by simply selecting the area of interest from the dropwown menu and selecting the dates for before and during floods. The flood map can be directly downloaded from the GEE app either in PNG or SHP format.<br/>

## Advanced version - [link](https://pratyush_tripathy.users.earthengine.app/view/global-flood-mapper-advanced)<br/>
The advanced version of the tool provides option to tweak a few parameters that influence the flood map. It permits the user to choose between ascending/descending pass, the threshold for Z value, water seasonality threshold, etc.
